# conwaylife 
Simple implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in python.
This is really just for fun, I plan on making the code more better (tm).
Run `life.py` for a simple terminal based output simulation.
Run `gui.py` for a simple TKInter gui that doesn't run very fast.
