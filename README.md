# conwaylife 
Simple implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in python.
This is really just for fun, I plan on making the code more better (tm).
Currently uses the python Tkinter library for Python3 (this can't be installed with pip).
Currently uses threading, albeit sloppily and slowly. Optimization is in progress.
