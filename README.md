# conwaylife 
Simple implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in python.
This is really just for fun, I plan on making the code more better (tm).
I also want to add a nice gui and other functionality.
Further testing needs to be done to make sure this simulation abides the rules of Conway's game of life, once larger grids can run at a reasonable pace.
